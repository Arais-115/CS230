# CS230 - Operating-Platforms

    Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
    The Gaming Room as a client was an experienced game developer with success in a puzzle competition game. They wished to move to a more mobile market and make the game available on multiple platforms across multiple devices.
    
    What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I documented all the clients requirements as well as their potential concerns regarding the transition to a multiple device setup. In addition, I also wrote a multiple recommendations to key areas that would need to be addressed in each environment, as well as potential solutions to each component. I provided recommendations to the best resolution to those concerns.
    
    What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Having a framework and clear concerns and outlines helped define the requirements ahead of time. This allowed me to develop the code within the outlines that were already defined with the design document. 
    
    If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
For me, looking more into each recommended section to which operating system, cloud system, and other parts could be further explored. As I only have a surface level knowledge of each benefit to each operating system, this area could be greatly expanded on. I would look through more documentation on what popular games and online services do, as a reference point. 
    
    How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The key component to each user I think is ease of use. A user needs to have minimum hardship and difficulty when operating the software from the user side, and the design needs to reflect that aspect. As well as security being a large concern, a end users data needs to be protected.
    
    How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I approached it with a rough sketch of an end product, we had clear goals that needed to be met, but how we achieved them we had flexibility in that area. Working with the client and providing solutions and analyzing feedback, we can provide the best solution to each problem by process of communication. I would also use this strategy in the future for future products, in order to facilitate the best end product that fulfills the clients requirements whilst also being user friendly.
